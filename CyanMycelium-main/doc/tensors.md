## Tensor Shape and Dimension

In linear algebra and machine learning, tensors are multi-dimensional data structures that store numerical data. Two essential properties of a tensor are its shape and dimension.

### Shape of a Tensor

The shape of a tensor refers to the number of elements along each dimension or axis of the tensor. It provides information about the structure and size of the tensor. The shape is represented as a tuple of positive integers, with each element of the tuple corresponding to the size of a specific dimension.

Examples:

- A 1D tensor (vector) with 5 elements has a shape of `(5,)`.
- A 2D tensor (matrix) with 3 rows and 4 columns has a shape of `(3, 4)`.
- A 3D tensor with 2 levels, 3 rows, and 4 columns has a shape of `(2, 3, 4)`.

### Dimension of a Tensor

The dimension of a tensor, also known as its rank, refers to the number of axes or indices required to access the elements of the tensor. In other words, it represents the number of dimensions the tensor has.

Examples:

- A scalar (0D tensor) has a dimension of `0`.
- A vector (1D tensor) has a dimension of `1`.
- A matrix (2D tensor) has a dimension of `2`.
- A 3D tensor has a dimension of `3`.

Tensors can have any number of dimensions, and each dimension can have any positive integer size. They are fundamental data structures used in various mathematical and computational operations, such as in linear algebra, machine learning, deep learning, and scientific computing.
